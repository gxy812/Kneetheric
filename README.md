# Kneetheric
## Project Name: Kneetheric.
### Project Description:
In light of knee rehabilitation efforts as well as the current Circuit Breaker situation, the team came up with Kneetheric. The Kneetheric is a multiplayer game played on smart devices, with the help of an external physical product: The Kneetheric’s Knee Brace. The Kneetheric’s Knee Brace uses rotational sensors to detect various knee movements. It is also equipped with Bluetooth and WiFi Wireless Connection features, which are used to send the data collected from the rotational sensors back to the smart device.
With respect to knee rehabilitation, Kneetheric targets patients who are recovering from recent knee surgeries. Consumers who are under knee rehabilitation will receive an additional special program on Kneetheric. This special program is equipped with specialized in-game illustration and advice that aims to improve the patient's health through supervised exercises. This ensures that patients are doing knee exercises in a proper manner, without causing any harm during the recovery process. In-game warning pop-ups will occur when sensors detect possible harmful movement or exercises. Copies of data collected from the Knee Brace will also be sent to the doctor and the patients themselves. Doctors can track and supervise the rehabilitation process while the patients can estimate how far they are, into their rehabilitation journey. This idea was constructed with reference to ExoRehab, a next-generation muscular rehabilitation solution that combines medical treatment with information and communication technology.
In consideration of the current Circuit Breaker situation, Kneetheric aims to entice consumers into exercising, with the entertainment of games. Knee and leg movements detected from Kneetheric’s Knee Brace will be transferred to the game where consumers can control their in-game character movements. This idea can be considered similar to PokemonGO, with the exception that Kneetheric does not require the consumer to be at the actual location in reality. While walking around at home or running on a treadmill, players can explore the world on google earth at their fingertips. Upon achieving daily targeted goals, players will also receive in-game achievement awards. Playing with friends and exercising will even grant players with bonus achievement prizes.
